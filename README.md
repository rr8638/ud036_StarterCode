# README - Movie Trailer Website Project
## Getting Started
Download the Python Final Project 3.0.zip file. Make sure all the files are together.
Install Idle (https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not installed.

### Running the file
Open the file "MOVIE TRAILER WEBSITE PROJECT".py, using IDLE - Python 2.7
Then, click on run module. This file imports both fresh tomatoes.py and media.py, which is why all files must be saved together.

## Contents of Each File
### fresh tomatoes.py
This file holds the formatting code that develops the webpage output, which ends up holding the list of movies produced by the "MOVIE TRAILER WEBSITE PROJECT.py" file.

### MOVIE TRAILER WEBSITE PROJECT.py
This file holds the data of each of my six favorite movies: “It’s a Wonderful Life”, “The Dark Knight, “The Lego Movie”, “Star Wars 6”, “Inception”, and “Looper”. Each of those movies acts as an object of class Movie from file "media.py". The data that is gathered is the movie title, movie description, poster url, and the trailer url. Then, fresh tomatoes.py is called and the website is created.

### media.py
This file houses the class Movie, which acts as the blueprint for storing each movie's data.
